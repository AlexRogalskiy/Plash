Make any website your desktop wallpaper.

This enables you to have a highly dynamic desktop wallpaper. You could display your favorite news site, Facebook feed, or a random beautiful scenery photo. The use-cases are limitless. You could even set an animated GIF as wallpaper.


■ Features

- Interact with the website (“Browse Mode”)
- Automatically reload the website at a custom interval
- Show the website on a different display
- Invert website colors (fake dark mode)
- Add custom CSS to the website
- Lower the opacity
- Transparent background
	If the website doesn't have a background color, your system wallpaper will show through.

Note: Support for multiple displays is currently limited to the ability to choose which display to show the website on. Support for setting a separate website for each display is planned.

■ Tip

You can interact with the website by enabling “Browsing Mode”. When in this mode, you can right-click to be able to go back/forward, reload, and zoom in the page contents. You can also pinch to magnify. This is different from zooming the page contents in that it will zoom in to a specific part of the page instead of just enlarging everything.
